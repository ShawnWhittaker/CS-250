Software Development Lifecycle

Answering the essential questions in computer science, interpretting user needs and implementing them into a program is the name of the game. Communicating with the clients and users, we create User Stories which help us develop the who, what, and why of our programs. We take that and develop the how, and our client gives us the when. With these three key components, we can create a solid plan and design quickly and efficiently to develop the program. Within Agile, the customer is the center focus. Changing requirements can be challenging, but Agile helps accommodate changes, with the Product Owner changing the Product Backlog, the developers can continue to maximize benefits the program can offer. Good team members are open and honest in their workload and in the opinions, especially if theirs differs from the majority of the group. Good team members also contribute to the project, completely their work on time or voicing help when needed to not hinder the project deadline.
